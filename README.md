HSE Good Catch Tracker  (Near Miss Tracker)
My last position was for a large manufacturing company.  Much of my time there was helping them digitize their process, automating them where I could. The only thing that I can think of that I left unfinished and delivered in the 10 years i worked for them wsa a good cath / close call tracker for their HSE (Health Safety and Environmen) diretor, so nataurlly it is what i thought of when tihs project came up.
